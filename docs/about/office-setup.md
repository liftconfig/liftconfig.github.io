# Office Setup

Since working from home I've been refining my office setup with an emphasis on ergonomics. I'm a big believer in investing in high quality tools to increase efficiency and make long sessions working and studying more enjoyable. Below is a breakdown of the equipment I'm currently using.

## Equipment

### Laptop: Macbook Pro

M2 Pro 16". The new ARM processors are serious workhorses and due to the high quality retina display I use the built-in display as a secondary monitor.

### Monitor: Apple Studio Display

I spent a long time researching monitors before settling on the ASD. I was considering an ultrawide (something along the lines of the G95NC for the extra screen real estate) but ultimately ended up with the ASD due to:

1. The screen is only being used for productivity. I spend the majority of my time in a terminal or IDE so picture quality and text sharpness is of primary importance.
2. There are limited 5K/6K monitor options on the market. These high resolutions both look great but also allow MacOS to scale efficiently.
3. When using the monitor with a Mac it wakes from sleep almost instantly, and you can control the monitor functions (brightness, volume) using the native MacOS controls.
4. Integrated speakers, webcam, and 4 port dock. The speakers are great considering they are built into the monitor. The webcam not so much, but still fine for online meetings.
5. Apple support is second to none. I've heard nightmare stories about trying to get support for faulty monitors from Samsung, LG etc.

Before the ASD my monitor setup consisted of 2x 4K 28" Samsung monitors + MBP display. The reduction in screen real estate is a downside but I have found less neck strain without the 28" side monitor and the ASD display quality is far superior. I have been using an iPad with sidecar for some additional screen real estate. I would consider upgrading to a 32" 6K display if a reasonable priced option becomes available. 

I've stuck a [LED light strip](https://www.amazon.com.au/PAUTIX-Dimmable-Backlight-Flexible-Lighting/dp/B0B1J57XS9?th=1) to the back of the ASD to provide back lighting. This provides excellent relief from eye strain during long sessions. I would recommend an adjustable LED strip as it allows you to dim the lights while working into the later hours.


### Tablet: iPad 10.9"

As mentioned above, this is used with sidecar for extra screen real estate. Usually I'll just keep Teams or Outlook open on the iPad. Being able to disconnect it at the end of the day and use it as a regular tablet is also a big benefit. I've found it's an invaluable tool for studying on the go (PDFs, Notion, Udemy etc). Also worth noting is that although I'm not a huge fan of Safari I've found the synced tab groups to be one of it's strongest features allowing me to have the same set of tabs open and synced across the laptop, tablet, and phone. I'll likely be looking to upgrade to a 12.9" when the 2024 models are available.

### Headphones: Airpod Pros

I've been using these since they were released in 2019. Active noise cancellation is a must when working from home or a busy office. The battery life, sound quality, and portability make these my go to headphones for both work and study.

### Keyboard: Dygma Raise

I first stumbled across the Raise when researching ergonomic keyboards. Split keyboards allow the wrists and shoulders to be in a more natural and neutral position which is particularly important for a those with a large shoulder width. I use the raise for the following reasons:
   1. It retains a standard keyboard layout. I didn't want the pain of switching between something more custom like the moonlander and a regular keyboard.
   2. It has great software for customising keys, layers, and macros.
   3. OEM Tenting kit available for additional ergonomics
   4. Hot swappable mechanical switches. I originally ordered the Raise with Kailh Silent Brown Switches. They were good but I've found my preference is for a silent tactile switch. I'm currently using the Outemu Cream yellow switches which is my favourite switch so far.

### Trackball: Ploopy Classic

Due to my HOTAS style keyboard/chair setup I either needed to use a trackpad or trackball. I did initially test out the magic trackpad but found it inefficent and slow for a lot of mouse heavy tasks. When researching trackballs, I found the Ploopy had some excellent reviews for both it's build quality and ergonomics. The design is essentially an upgraded replica of the Microsof Trackball Explorer. This is my first trackball and I'm a convert, now using it both at home and in the office. I will say on MacOS SteerMouse is a must when using a tracbkall as it allows you to customise everything about the device, as well as per app behaviour and macros. Autoscroll is also a gamechanger as enables 2D scrolling using the trackball when a button is held down. Steermouse will allow you to adjust the autoscroll scrolling speed independent of the standard mouse movements.


### Chair: Hermon Miller Aeron

This is the remastered edition in size C with the aftermarket Atlas headrest and rollerblade wheels. Aerons are a gold standard in the ergonomic chair world due to the level of customisation available when setting them up. I found the post by one of the HM product managers in to the chair, but typically it's used as a guide so I can feel where my head/neck should be when in the more task based position.his [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ergonomics/comments/q6xmju/ive_been_having_a_lot_of_neck_and_back_pain_im/) to be the most useful explanation of how to properly set it up. I typically use the chair with the tilt adjuster unlocked (for that floating feeling) in a 90 degree upright task based position. The only time I use the headrest to support my head is on the odd occasion I'm leaning back in the chair, the rest of the time I use it as a guide to feel where my head and neck should be in the more task based position.

Mention HOTAS mounts.

### Mounting: Dual Monitor Wall Mount
