# Office Setup

Since working from home I've been refining my office setup with an emphasis on ergonomics. The following is a breakdown of the equipment I'm currently using

## Equipment

### Laptop: Macbook Pro

M2 Pro 16". The new ARM processors are serious workhorses and due to the high quality retina display I use the built-in display as a secondary monitor.

### Monitor: Apple Studio Display

I spent a long time researching monitors before settling on the ASD. I was considering an ultrawide (something along the lines of the G95NC for the extra screen real estate) but ultimately ended up with the ASD due to:

1. The screen is only being used for productivity. I spend the majority of my time in a terminal or IDE so picture quality and text sharpness is of primary importance.
2. There are limited 5k/6k monitor options on the market. These high resolutions both look great but also allow MacOS to scale efficiently.
3. When using the monitor with a Mac it wakes from sleep almost instantly, and you can control the monitor functions (brightness, volume) using the native MacOS controls.
4. Integrated speakers, webcam, and 4 port dock. The speakers are great considering they are built into the monitor. The webcam not so much, but still fine for online meetings.
5. Apple support is second to none. I've heard nightmare stories about trying to get support for faulty monitors from the likes of Samsung, LG etc.

I did originally use 2x 4k 28" Samsung monitors before the ASD. The reduction in screen real estate is a downside but I have found less neck strain (no additional 28" monitor off to the side) and the ASD display quality is far superior. I have been using an iPad with sidecar to add offset the loss of some of the real estate

I've also stuck a [LED light strip](https://www.amazon.com.au/PAUTIX-Dimmable-Backlight-Flexible-Lighting/dp/B0B1J57XS9?th=1) to the back of the ASD to provide back lighting. This provides excellent relief from eye strain during long sessions. I would recommend an adjustable LED strip so that you can dim the back lights while using at night.


### Tablet: iPad 2019 10.9"

As mentioned above, this is used with sidecar for extra laptop real estate. Usually I'll just keep Teams or Outlook open on the iPad. Being able to disconnect it at the end of the day and use it as a regular tablet is a big benefit. I've found it's an invaluable tool for studying on the go (PDFs, Notion, Udemy etc). Also, although I'm not a huge fan of Safari I've found the synced tab groups to be one of it's strongest features allowing me to have the same set of tabs open and synced across the laptop, tablet, and phone.
